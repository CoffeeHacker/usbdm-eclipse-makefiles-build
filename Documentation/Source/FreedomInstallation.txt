  - Cut the PCB trace on the <b>bottom</b> of the board under J11.  This trace connects the SWD hardware to the MKL25Z128M4 device on the board.  
    It must be opened to allow an external target to be connected without interference from the on-board chip.\n
    Connection to the on-board target may be restored by adding pins and a jumper at J11.\n\n

  - Add a 10-pin connector at location J6 which is also marked SWD.  Do not confuse this with the similar connector at J8 marked SDA/SWD.\n
    A suitable connector would be Element-14 #681-1184.  This is an unprotected header.\n\n

  - Procure a 10-pin to 10-pin programming cable to connect to the target.  The cheapest I've found has been from Element14 #2144328.\n\n

\section FreedomFirmwareInstallation Installing USBDM firmware on FRDM-KL25Z
   Install the USBDM software and USBDM drivers before doing the following:  \n
   
   The installation of the USBDM firmware uses the usual FRDM-KL25 bootloader process.\n
   - Locate the USBDM_OpenSDA.sx file in the USBDM firmware directory. This is an OpenSDA application.
   - Unplug the FRDM-KL25 board.
   - Whilst holding the reset switch depressed plug in the FRDM-KL25 board.  The green LED should start blinking at a rate of about 1Hz.  
   - Open a file explorer and locate the USB drive that has now appeared.  It will have the drive name "BOOTLOADER".
   - Drag the file USBDM_OpenSDA.sx to the USB drive and wait a short while.  The OpenSDA firmware on the FRDM-KL25 board will 
     program the USBDM firmware into the MK20 debugger chip on the board.
   - Remove and re-plug the FRDM-KL25 board.  The board will now appear as a USBDM device.
   
   You can test the interface by trying the stand-alone ARM flash programmer that is part of the USBDM installation. Placing a jumper on J-11
   will allow the programming of the MKL25Z128M4 chip on the FRDM board.  It is necessary to open J-11 and use the cable for external targets.
