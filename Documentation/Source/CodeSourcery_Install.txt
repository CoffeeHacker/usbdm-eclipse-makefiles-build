This page provides brief instructions on how to set up CodeSourcery Lite for use with 
Eclipse IDE and USBDM BDM hardware for Kinetis and Coldfire targets on a MS-Windows platform.

\section requiredSoftware Required Software
The following software needs to be installed:\n
-  <b>Eclipse Juno</b> \n
   I do java programming as well as C so I usually download the Java version and add CDT plugins from scratch (in the next step). 
   Alternatively, if only doing C programming then the CDT version can be downloaded.\n
   Download from: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\n
   Download either\n
   -  <b>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</b> (add CDT in next step)\n
   -  <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> (only add the GDB plugins in next step)\n
   .
   Unzip to a suitable permanent location for the application e.g. "C:\Apps\Eclipse".\n
   Create a program object for the main eclipse application "C:\Apps\Eclipse\eclipse.exe" \n \n
-  <b>CDT GDB plugins (also CDT if Java only option was chosen above)</b> \n
   Launch Eclipse and select \b "Help->Install New Software..." from the menu.\n
   Click the \b Add button at the top-right of the dialogue.\n
   Complete as shown to add a repository for the CDT plugins.
   \verbatim
   CDT Plugin
   http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/juno
   \endverbatim
   \image html Add_CDT_Repository.png
   \n Select the added item at the top of the dialogue and then select the following items (versions may vary):\n
   \verbatim
   C/C++ Development Tools             8.1.1.201209170703
   C/C++ GCC Cross Compiler Support    1.1.0.201209170703
   C/C++ GDB Hardware Debugging        7.0.0.201209170703	
   C/C++ Memory View Enhancements      2.2.0.201209170703
   \endverbatim
   \image html Install_CDT_Plugin_Selection.png 
   \n
   Click next and accept the various prompt to complete installation.  Reboot if prompted.\n \n
-  <b>ARM for Eclipse plugin (Not all BDMs support ARM)</b> \n
   In theory it's possible to set up Eclipse for a ARM target from scratch using the GCC Cross Compiler Support plugin.  
   In practice the ARM for Eclipse plugin makes setting up a project much easier.
   Information about this plugin is available at http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/blog/ \n
   This plugin can be installed in the same way as the CDT plugin above.  Just add the following repository:
   \verbatim
   ARM Plugin
   http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates	
   \endverbatim
   Select the added item at the top of the dialogue and then select the following item (version may vary):\n
   \verbatim
   GNU ARM C/C++ Development Support    0.5.4.201202210114
   \endverbatim
   Complete the process and reboot if prompted. \n \n
-  <b>Codesourcery Lite</b> \n
   Download from: http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/codesourcery \n
   Choose the software for the appropriate target.\n 
   Run the installer to install to the default location "C:\Program Files\CodeSourcery\Sourcery_CodeBench_Lite_for_...."
   Allow the installer to modify the PATHs  . \n \n
-  <b>Install USBDM</b> \n
   This must be done after installing Codesourcery since it adds various files to the Codesourcery installation.
